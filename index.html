        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is <strong>Alex Martinez-Lopez</strong> and I am a
          Computer Science student at Portland State University. I am currently
          a senior, graduating in June 2026. I have hands-on experience with
          C++, Python, Java, C, SQL, Javscript, CSS, HTML and Linux systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a strong interest in <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and plan to
          pursue a career in the field. Through my coursework, I have developed
          an appreciation for secure coding practices, system-level programming,
          and the importance of protecting data. I am actively expanding my
          knowledge in different areas through additional security courses and
          continued learning as I prepare for a cybersecurity-focused path.
        </p>
